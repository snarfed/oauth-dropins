About
---

This is a collection of drop-in Python request handlers for the initial [OAuth](http://oauth.net/) client flows for many popular sites, including Blogger, Disqus, Dropbox, Facebook, Flickr, GitHub, Google, IndieAuth, Instagram, LinkedIn, Mastodon, Medium, Tumblr, Twitter, and WordPress.com.

* [Available on PyPi.](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/oauth-dropins/) Install with `pip install oauth-dropins`.
* [Click here for getting started docs.](#quick-start)
* [Click here for reference docs.](https://oauth-dropins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/oauth_dropins.html)
* A demo app is deployed at [oauth-dropins.appspot.com](http://oauth-dropins.appspot.com/).

oauth-dropins stores user credentials in [Google Cloud Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/). It's primarily designed for [Google App Engine](https://appengine.google.com/), but it can be used in any Python web application, regardless of host or framework.

[Versions 3.0](https://pypi.org/project/oauth-dropins/3.0/) and above support App Engine's [Python 3 runtimes](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/), both [Standard](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/) and [Flexible](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/). If you're on the [Python 2 runtime](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/), use [version 2.2](https://pypi.org/project/oauth-dropins/2.2/).

If you clone the repo directly or want to contribute, see [Development](#development) for setup instructions.

This software is released into the public domain. See LICENSE for details.


Quick start
---

Here's a full example of using the Facebook drop-in.

1. Install oauth-dropins with `pip install oauth-dropins`.
1. Put your [Facebook application's](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) ID and secret in two plain text files in your app's root directory, `facebook_app_id` and `facebook_app_secret`. (If you use git, you'll probably also want to add them to your `.gitignore`.)
1. Create a `facebook_oauth.py` file with these contents:

    ```python
    from oauth_dropins import facebook
    import webapp2
    
    application = webapp2.WSGIApplication([
      ('/facebook/start_oauth', facebook.StartHandler.to('/facebook/oauth_callback')),
      ('/facebook/oauth_callback', facebook.CallbackHandler.to('/next'))]
    ```

1. Add these lines to `app.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    - url: /facebook/(start_oauth|oauth_callback)
      script: facebook_oauth.application
      secure: always
    ```

Voila! Send your users to `/facebook/start_oauth` when you want them to connect their Facebook account to your app, and when they're done, they'll be redirected to `/next?access_token=...` in your app.

All of the sites provide the same API. To use a different one, just import the site module you want and follow the same steps. The filenames for app keys and secrets also differ by site; see each silo's `.py` file for its filenames.


Usage details
---

There are three main parts to an OAuth drop-in: the initial redirect to the site
itself, the redirect back to your app after the user approves or declines the
request, and the datastore entity that stores the user's OAuth credentials and
helps you use them. These are implemented by [`StartHandler`](#starthandler),
[`CallbackHandler`](#callbackhandler), and [auth entities](#auth-entities),
respectively.

The request handlers are full [WSGI](http://wsgi.org/) applications and may be
used in any Python web framework that supports WSGI
([PEP 333](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/)). Internally, they're
implemented with [webapp2](http://webapp-improved.appspot.com/).


### `StartHandler`

This HTTP request handler class redirects you to an OAuth-enabled site so it can ask
the user to grant your app permission. It has two useful methods:

- `to(callback_path, scopes=None)` is a factory method that returns a request
  handler class you can use in a WSGI application. The argument should be the
  path mapped to [`CallbackHandler`](#callbackhandler) in your application. This
  also usually needs to match the callback URL in your app's configuration on
  the destination site.

  If you want to add OAuth scopes beyond the default one(s) needed for login,
  you can pass them to the `scopes` kwarg as a string or sequence of strings, or
  include them in the `scopes` query parameter in the POST request body. This is
  currently supported with Facebook, Google, Blogger, and Instagram.

  Some of the sites that use OAuth 1 support alternatives. For Twitter,
  `StartHandler.to` takes an additional `access_type` kwarg that may be `read`
  or `write`. It's passed through to Twitter
  [`x_auth_access_type`](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/post/oauth/request_token).
  For Flickr, the start handler accepts a `perms` POST query parameter that may
  be `read`, `write` or `delete`; it's
  [passed through to Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/auth.oauth.html#authorization)
  unchanged. (Flickr claims it's optional, but
  [sometimes breaks if it's not provided.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6517317/flickr-api-error-when-oauth))

- `redirect_url(state=None)` returns the URL to redirect to at the destination
  site to initiate the OAuth flow. `StartHandler` will redirect here
  automatically if it's used in a WSGI application, but you can also instantiate
  it and call this manually if you want to control that redirect yourself:

```python
class MyHandler(webapp2.RequestHandler):
  def get(self):
    ...
    handler_cls = facebook.StartHandler.to('/facebook/oauth_callback')
    handler = handler_cls(self.request, self.response)
    self.redirect(handler.redirect_url())
```

  However, this is *not* currently supported for Google and Blogger. Hopefully
  that will be fixed in the future.


### `CallbackHandler`

This class handles the HTTP redirect back to your app after the user has granted
or declined permission. It also has two useful methods:

- `to(callback_path)` is a factory method that returns a request handler class
  you can use in a WSGI application, similar to [`StartHandler`](#starthandler).
  The callback path is the path in your app that users should be redirected to
  after the OAuth flow is complete. It will include a `state` query parameter
  with the value provided by the `StartHandler`. It will also include an OAuth
  token in its query parameters, either `access_token` for OAuth 2.0 or
  `access_token_key` and `access_token_secret` for OAuth 1.1. It will also
  include an `auth_entity` query parameter with the string key of an
  [auth entity](#auth-entities) that has more data (and functionality) for the
  authenticated user. If the user declined the OAuth authorization request, the
  only query parameter besides `state` will be `declined=true`.

- `finish(auth_entity, state=None)` is run in the initial callback request after
  the OAuth response has been processed. `auth_entity` is the newly created auth
  entity for this connection, or `None` if the user declined the OAuth
  authorization request.

  By default, `finish` redirects to the path you specified in `to()`, but you
  can subclass `CallbackHandler` and override it to run your own code inside the
  OAuth callback instead of redirecting:

```python
class MyCallbackHandler(facebook.CallbackHandler):
  def finish(self, auth_entity, state=None):
    self.response.write('Hi %s, thanks for connecting your %s account.' %
        (auth_entity.user_display_name(), auth_entity.site_name()))
```

  However, this is *not* currently supported for Google and Blogger. Hopefully
  that will be fixed in the future.

### Auth entities

Each site defines an App Engine datastore
[ndb.Model class](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/entities#Python_Kinds_and_identifiers)
that stores each user's OAuth credentials and other useful information, like
their name and profile URL. The class name is of the form <em>Site</em>Auth, e.g.
FacebookAuth. Here are the useful methods:

- `site_name()` returns the human-readable string name of the site, e.g.
  "Facebook".

- `user_display_name()` returns a human-readable string name for the user, e.g.
  "Ryan Barrett". This is usually their first name, full name, or username.

- `access_token()` returns the OAuth access token. For OAuth 2 sites, this is a
  single string. For OAuth 1.1 sites (currently just Twitter, Tumblr, and Flickr),
  this is a `(string key, string secret)` tuple.

The following methods are optional. Auth entity classes usually implement at
least one of them, but not all.

- `api()` returns a site-specific API object. This is usually a third party
  library dedicated to the site, e.g. [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)
  or [python-instagram](https://github.com/Instagram/python-instagram). See the
  site class's docstring for details.

- `urlopen(data=None, timeout=None)` wraps `urlopen()` and adds the
  OAuth credentials to the request. Use this for making direct HTTP request to a
  site's REST API. Some sites may provide `get()` instead, which wraps
  `requests.get()`.


Troubleshooting/FAQ
---
1. If you get this error:

    ```
    bash: ./bin/easy_install: ...bad interpreter: No such file or directory
    ```

  You've probably hit [this virtualenv bug](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/53): virtualenv doesn't support paths with spaces.

  The easy fix is to recreate the virtualenv in a path without spaces. If you can't do that, then after creating the virtualenv, but before activating it, edit the activate, easy_install and pip files in `local3/bin/` to escape any spaces in the path.

  For example, in `activate`, `VIRTUAL_ENV=".../has space/local"` becomes `VIRTUAL_ENV=".../has\ space/local"`, and in `pip` and `easy_install` the first line changes from `#!".../has space/local3/bin/python"` to `#!".../has\ space/local3/bin/python"`.

  This should get virtualenv to install in the right place. If you do this wrong at first, you'll have installs in eg `/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages` that you need to delete, since they'll prevent virtualenv from installing into the local `site-packages`.

1. If you see errors importing or using `tweepy`, it may be because `six.py` isn't installed. Try `pip install six` manually. `tweepy` does include `six` in its dependencies, so this shouldn't be necessary. Please [let us know](https://github.com/snarfed/oauth-dropins/issues) if it happens to you so we can debug!

1. If you get an error like this:

    ```
    Running setup.py develop for gdata
    ...
    error: option --home not recognized
    ...
    InstallationError: Command /usr/bin/python -c "import setuptools, tokenize; __file__='/home/singpolyma/src/bridgy/src/gdata/setup.py'; exec(compile(getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__).read().replace('\r\n', '\n'), __file__, 'exec'))" develop --no-deps --home=/tmp/tmprBISz_ failed with error code 1 in .../src/gdata
    ```

  ...you may be hitting [Pip bug 1833](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/1833).
  Are you passing `-t` to `pip install`? Use the virtualenv instead, it's your
  friend. If you really want `-t`, try removing the `-e` from the lines in
  `requirements.txt` that have it.

1. If you get this error while running `dev_appserver.py`:

    ```
    RuntimeError: Cannot use the Cloud Datastore Emulator because the packaged grpcio is incompatible to this system. Please install grpcio using pip
    ```

  ...you can fix it by [installing `grpcio` into the Python 2 that you're running`dev_appserver` with](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59996186/186123). Usually this is just `sudo python2 -m pip install grpcio`.


Changelog
---

### 3.0 - 2020-03-14

_Breaking changes:_

* _Python 2 is no longer supported!_ Including the [App Engine Standard Python 2 runtime](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/). On the plus side, the [Python 3 runtimes](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/), both [Standard](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/) and [Flexible](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/), are now supported.
* Replace `handlers.memcache_response()`, which used Python 2 App Engine's memcache service, with `cache_response()`, which uses local runtime memory.
* Remove the `handlers.TemplateHandler.USE_APPENGINE_WEBAPP` toggle to use Python 2 App Engine's `google.appengine.ext.webapp2.template` instead of Jinja.
* Blogger:
  * Login is now based on [Google Sign-In](https://developers.google.com/identity/). The `api_from_creds()`, `creds()`, and `http()` methods have been removed. Use the remaining `api()` method to get a `BloggerClient`, or `access_token()` to make API calls manually.
* Google:
  * Replace `GoogleAuth` with the new `GoogleUser` NDB model class, which [doesn't depend on the deprecated oauth2client](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2client-deprecation.html).
  * Drop `http()` method (which returned an `httplib2.Http`).
* Mastodon:
  * `StartHandler`: drop `APP_NAME`/`APP_URL` class attributes and `app_name`/`app_url` kwargs in the `to()` method and replace them with new `app_name()`/`app_url()` methods that subclasses should override, since they often depend on WSGI environment variables like `HTTP_HOST` and `SERVER_NAME` that are available during requests but not at runtime startup.
* `webutil`:
  * Drop `handlers.memcache_response()` since the Python 3 runtime doesn't include memcache.
  * Drop `handlers.TemplateHandler` support for `webapp2.template` via `USE_APPENGINE_WEBAPP`, since the Python 3 runtime doesn't include `webapp2` built in.
  * Remove `cache` and `fail_cache_time_secs` kwargs from `util.follow_redirects()`. Caching is now built in. You can bypass the cache with `follow_redirects.__wrapped__()`. [Details.](https://cachetools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#cachetools.cached)

Non-breaking changes:

* Add Meetup support. (Thanks [Jamie Tanna](https://www.jvt.me/)!)
* Blogger, Google:
  * The `state` query parameter now works!
* Add new `outer_classes` kwarg to `button_html()` for the outer `<div>`, eg as Bootstrap columns.
* Add new `image_file` kwarg to `StartHandler.button_html()`

### 2.2 - 2019-11-01
* Add LinkedIn and Mastodon!
* Add Python 3.7 support, and improve overall Python 3 compatibility.
* Add new `button_html()` method to all `StartHandler` classes. Generates the same button HTML and styling as on [oauth-dropins.appspot.com](https://oauth-dropins.appspot.com/).
* Blogger: rename module from `blogger_v2` to `blogger`. The `blogger_v2` module name is still available as an alias, implemented via symlink, but is now deprecated.
* Dropbox: fix crash with unicode header value.
* Google: fix crash when user object doesn't have `name` field.
* Facebook: [upgrade Graph API version from 2.10 to 4.0.](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/changelog)
* Update a number of dependencies.
* Switch from Python's built in `json` module to [`ujson`](https://github.com/esnme/ultrajson/) (built into App Engine) to speed up JSON parsing and encoding.

### 2.0 - 2019-02-25
* _Breaking change_: switch from [Google+ Sign-In](https://developers.google.com/+/web/signin/) ([which shuts down in March](https://developers.google.com/+/api-shutdown)) to [Google Sign-In](https://developers.google.com/identity/). Notably, this removes the `googleplus` module and adds a new `google_signin` module, renames the `GooglePlusAuth` class to  `GoogleAuth`, and removes its `api()` method. Otherwise, the implementation is mostly the same.
* webutil.logs: return HTTP 400 if `start_time` is before 2008-04-01 (App Engine's rough launch window).

### 1.14 - 2018-11-12
* Fix dev_appserver in Cloud SDK 219 / `app-engine-python` 1.9.76 and onward. [Background.](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/117145272#comment25)
* Upgrade `google-api-python-client` from 1.6.3 to 1.7.4 to [stop using the global HTTP Batch endpoint](https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/03/discontinuing-support-for-json-rpc-and.html).
* Other minor internal updates.

### 1.13 - 2018-08-08
* IndieAuth: support JSON code verification responses as well as form-encoded ([snarfed/bridgy#809](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/809)).

### 1.12 - 2018-03-24
* More Python 3 updates and bug fixes in webutil.util.

### 1.11 - 2018-03-08
* Add GitHub!
* Facebook:
    * Pass `state` to the initial OAuth endpoint directly, instead of encoding it into the redirect URL, so the redirect can [match the Strict Mode whitelist](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2017/12/18/strict-uri-matching/).
* Add Python 3 support to webutil.util!
* Add humanize dependency for webutil.logs.

### 1.10 - 2017-12-10
Mostly just internal changes to webutil to support granary v1.10.

### 1.9 - 2017-10-24

* Medium:
    * Bug fix for Medium OAuth callback error handling.
* IndieAuth:
    * Store authorization endpoint in state instead of rediscovering it from `me` parameter, [which is going away](https://github.com/aaronpk/IndieAuth.com/issues/167).

Development
---
First, fork and clone this repo. Then, you'll need the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) with the `gcloud-appengine-python` and `gcloud-appengine-python-extras` [components](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/components#additional_components). Once you have them, set up your environment by running these commands in the repo root directory:

```shell
gcloud config set project oauth-dropins
git submodule init
git submodule update
python3 -m venv local3
source local3/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the demo app locally [in dev_appserver.py](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/testing-and-deploying-your-app#local-dev-server) ([so that static files work](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/google-appengine/BJDE8y2KISM/discussion)) with:

```shell
dev_appserver.py --log_level debug --enable_host_checking false \
  --support_datastore_emulator --datastore_emulator_port=8089 \
  --application=oauth-dropins app.yaml
```

Most dependencies are clean, but we've made patches to [gdata-python-client](https://github.com/snarfed/gdata-python-client), which is unmaintained but we still need for [Blogger's v2 API](https://developers.google.com/blogger/docs/2.0/developers_guide_protocol).

* [snarfed/gdata-python-client@fabb622](https://github.com/snarfed/gdata-python-client/commit/fabb6227361612ac4fcb8bef4438719cb00eaa2b)
* [snarfed/gdata-python-client@8453e33](https://github.com/snarfed/gdata-python-client/commit/8453e3388d152ac650e22d219fae36da56d9a85d)

To deploy to production:

`gcloud -q beta app deploy --no-cache oauth-dropins *.yaml`

The docs are built with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/), including [apidoc](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/man/sphinx-apidoc.html), [autodoc](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/autodoc.html), and [napoleon](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/napoleon.html). Configuration is in [`docs/conf.py`](https://github.com/snarfed/oauth-dropins/blob/master/docs/conf.py) To build them, first install Sphinx with `pip install sphinx`. (You may want to do this outside your virtualenv; if so, you'll need to reconfigure it to see system packages with `python3 -m venv --system-site-packages local3`.) Then, run [`docs/build.sh`](https://github.com/snarfed/oauth-dropins/blob/master/docs/build.sh).


Release instructions
---
Here's how to package, test, and ship a new release. (Note that this is [largely duplicated in granary's readme too](https://github.com/snarfed/granary#release-instructions).)

1. Run the unit tests.
    ```sh
    source local3/bin/activate.csh
    CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT=oauth-dropins gcloud beta emulators datastore start --consistency=1.0 < /dev/null >& /dev/null &
    sleep 2s
    DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8081 DATASTORE_DATASET=oauth-dropins \
      python3 -m unittest discover
    kill %1
    deactivate
    ```
1. Bump the version number in `setup.py` and `docs/conf.py`. `git grep` the old version number to make sure it only appears in the changelog. Change the current changelog entry in `README.md` for this new version from _unreleased_ to the current date.
1. Build the docs. If you added any new modules, add them to the appropriate file(s) in `docs/source/`. Then run `./docs/build.sh`.
1. `git commit -am 'release vX.Y'`
1. Upload to [test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org/) for testing.
    ```sh
    python3 setup.py clean build sdist
    setenv ver X.Y
    source local3/bin/activate.csh
    twine upload -r pypitest dist/oauth-dropins-$ver.tar.gz
    ```
1. Install from test.pypi.org.
    ```sh
    cd /tmp
    python3 -m venv local3
    source local3/bin/activate.csh
    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    # mf2py 1.1.2 on test.pypi.org is broken :(
    pip3 install mf2py
    pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple oauth-dropins
    deactivate
    ```
1. Smoke test that the code trivially loads and runs.
    ```sh
    source local3/bin/activate.csh
    python3
    # run test code below
    deactivate
    ```
    Test code to paste into the interpreter:
    ```py
    from oauth_dropins.webutil import util
    util.__file__
    util.UrlCanonicalizer()('http://asdf.com')
    # should print 'https://asdf.com/'
    exit()
    ```
1. Tag the release in git. In the tag message editor, delete the generated comments at bottom, leave the first line blank (to omit the release "title" in github), put `### Notable changes` on the second line, then copy and paste this version's changelog contents below it.
    ```sh
    git tag -a v$ver --cleanup=verbatim
    git push
    git push --tags
    ```
1. [Click here to draft a new release on GitHub.](https://github.com/snarfed/oauth-dropins/releases/new) Enter `vX.Y` in the _Tag version_ box. Leave _Release title_ empty. Copy `### Notable changes` and the changelog contents into the description text box.
1. Upload to [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/)!
    ```sh
    twine upload dist/oauth-dropins-$ver.tar.gz
    ```
